As for static members there is only one copy maintained that is shared by all the objects, 

Initial value for currInterestRate  is: 0.04
Three objects are created s1,s2 and s3
Current Balance for s1 is set to 50
Current Balance for s2 is set to 100
s1.GetInterestRateObj() is called, it will return currInterestRate value as 0.04
s2.SetInterestRateObj(0.08) is called, it will set currInterestRate to 0.08
s1.GetInterestRateObj() is called it will return currInterestRate value as 0.08 (currInterestRate is static, so value changed through s2 obj will reflect in s1 obj)
Current Balance for s2 is set to 10000.75
SavingAccount.GetInterestRate() is called, it will set currInterestRate to 0.08
OUTPUT: (c)0.04,0.08,0.08
